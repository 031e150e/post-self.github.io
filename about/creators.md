Adding an entry for yourself? Sweet! All that's required is that you create a level 3 header that can be linked to. If your name is one word, like 'Makyo', you're good to go: you can link to it with post-self.github.io/about/creators#makyo or similar (notice lowercase), as Jekyll will automatically make it linkable:

### Makyo

If your name is more complicated, like 'Madision "Makyo" Scott-Clary', then you'll need to pick something linkable (e.g: makyo) and use that as the ID in the header:

### Madison "Makyo" Scott-Clary
{: id="makyo" }

After that, simply write a few sentences about yourself, and you're good to go!

### Makyo

Makyo is an author, programmer, and composer living outside of Loveland, CO. She's decidedly trans, aggressively poly, kinda ace, and hecka queer.
