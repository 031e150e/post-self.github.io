{% include toc/help.md %}

One may contribute to *Post-Self*, either modifying the site or adding a story, through [GitHub](https://github.com/post-self/post-self.github.io). Accounts at GitHub are free, of course, and will let you contribute to this project and many others.

The usage of GitHub and git to work with a project like this are beyond the scope of this document, but there are some [resources](#resources) toward the end of this document for that. Here are the basics, though:

1. Fork the [post-self.github.io](https://github.com/post-self/post-self.github.io) repository
2. Create a new branch with your changes or added story
3. Create a pull-request against `post-self/post-self.github.io` with your changes
4. Make sure CI passes (site is built, links are checked)
5. Those with editorial access will review and merge your changes, or offer up some suggestions for changes to make
6. When your changes land, they'll automatically go live on the site

### "But I don't want to deal with Jekyll!"

You can [create an issue](https://github.com/post-self/post-self.github.io/issues/new) on the project and attach a file there, and it will get added to the site.

You can also [email Makyo](mailto:makyo+post-self@drab-makyo.com) your stories and she'll add them with proper attribution, but this is a last resort `:)`
